Majority of the time spent on **6** and on **0** - how to structure the app? Whether to use generators, seed projects, build systems... In the end decided to write all of my code by hand

= Running the app =

1. clone the repo
2. npm install
3. node app.js
4. localhost:3000

== Requirements ==

* MongoDB installed and running

= Running the test =

1. node.js tests are run via ```mocha``` *(you may want to install it globally)*
2. front-end tests: ```CountriesService-tests.html``` *(just double click and it should work)*
